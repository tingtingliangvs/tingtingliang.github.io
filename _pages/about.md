Hi, I am Hendrik. I enjoy learning, teaching, bringing people together, 
and activities that reward problem solving and creativity -- like programming. 
I study 
[Computational Visualistics at the University of Koblenz](https://www.uni-koblenz-landau.de/en/campus-koblenz/fb4/icv?set_language=en).

Usually I write code in` C/C++` or` python`. 
I am most experienced with` computer graphics`,` gpu programming` and scientific` simulation` 
and` visualization`. I have also worked with embedded systems and microcontrollers, 
UI and websites. Check out the [projects](projects) section for a selection of my public projects. 
Many other programming languages have crossed my path and I am quick to try a new tool for a project, 
as the basic skills of programming and software engineering carry over well.

Starting from April you can hire me for your project as a freelancer. 
Send me an email if you are interested. I also like to teach, give talks, 
and provide private [tutoring](tutoring) in programming and computer science. 

Before studying Computational Visualistics I worked in video production, 
where I have acquired some skills in `graphics design`,` photograpy` and` videography`. 
I am happy to offer those alongside my programming work.

Other interests of mine are` cooking`,` electronics`,` photography`,` reading`,` writing`,` games`,` art` 
and. You can check out the [blog](blog), where you can learn more about these.
