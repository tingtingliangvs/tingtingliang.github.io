I am a Ph.D. student at <a href='https://english.pku.edu.cn/' >Peking University</a> , advised by <a href='https://www.icst.pku.edu.cn/english/people/tt/1297391.htm' >Prof. Zhi Tang</a> and <a href='https://www.icst.pku.edu.cn/xztd/1298696.htm' >Prof. Yongtao Wang</a>.  <mark>I plan to finish my PhD in july 2023 and am looking for postdoc positions!<mark>

**Research**: I am excited about developing deep models with hand-designed and automated search methods to solve computer
vision challenges. Currently, my research focuses on learning 2D and 3D representations of objects and scenes
towards improving accuracy and robustness of perception tasks in complex environments. Outside my research, I love <a href='https://tingtingliangvs.github.io/gallery/' >painting</a>, swimming, and reading literature.
