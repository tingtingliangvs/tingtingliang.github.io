<!-- I received a Ph.D. degree in July. 2023 at <a href='https://english.pku.edu.cn/' >Peking University</a> , advised by <a href='https://www.icst.pku.edu.cn/english/people/tt/1297391.htm' >Prof. Zhi Tang</a> and <a href='https://www.icst.pku.edu.cn/xztd/1298696.htm' >Prof. Yongtao Wang</a>.   -->


**Bio**: I joined NVIDIA as an engineer in 2023. Before that, I received my Ph.D. in computer applied technology at <a href='https://english.pku.edu.cn/' >Peking University</a>, China, in 2023, and I received the B.E. degree from the School of Computer Science, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China, in 2018.

**Research**: I am excited about developing deep models with hand-designed and automated search methods to solve computer
vision challenges. Currently, my research focuses on learning 2D and 3D representations of objects and scenes
towards improving accuracy and robustness of perception tasks in complex environments. Outside my research, I love <a href='https://tingtingliangvs.github.io/gallery/' >drawing</a>, swimming, and reading literature.
